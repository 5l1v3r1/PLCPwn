PLCPwn
======

PLCPwn is a project that was written in ruby to support a RaspberryPi and a DroneCell. 
This is a specific example using the DroneCell to recieve a text message and to send
out the ControlLogix STOP CPU command. 

This should be ran by a rc.d script or a cronjob to ensure the script is up and running.
